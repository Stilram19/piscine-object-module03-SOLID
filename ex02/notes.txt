(*) The liskov substitution principle was proposed by the pioneer Barbara liskov, it states that substituting
a supertype by each of its subtypes mustn't break the program.
In our case, supertypes are base classes, and subtypes are child classes:
It states that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable by objects of its subclasses
without breaking the program.

Respecting the liskov substitution principle, you can use polymorphism without worry.
