(*) The liskov substitution principle was proposed by the pioneer Barbara liskov, it states that substituting
a supertype by each of its subtypes mustn't break the program.
In our case, supertypes are base classes, and subtypes are child classes:
It states that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable by objects of its subclasses
without breaking the program.

To me if you adhere to this principle, you've just proved that you can only use references, or pointers
of supertype to work with any subtype. According to the definition of the princple, we only
care about the inherited interface, is it overriden such that it respects the liskov substitution principle?
that's the question.
